run dfs with random
find sink, run dfs on reverse
consider vertex weight
merge teams together if possible

run algorithm multiple times (hour +)
find highest vertex or 2, do dfs from there (greedy)
run both algorithm on each input, selected max
brute force 4 vertices graphs (consider every path, 4!)
